Trying to refine my project, creted in IntelliJ IDEA.

7/21/18 9 Through trial and error, I have discovered that a hybrid 
Jython/Java project cannot be done. The reason is due to that Jython 
needs to point to the class files. So, the Java part will be created and
 bundled into a JAR, then I will create a Jython project to call the 
 classes from the JAR and proceed accordingly.
